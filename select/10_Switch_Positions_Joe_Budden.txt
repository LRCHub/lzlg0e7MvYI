See these other dudes is into you cuz you fine
And even thats fine, I dont mind alright
Me, I have fun my whole life
You can find that anywhere
Its about lil more than that over here
Its more than just a after-sex
Call me when you want something else
From something til

Top off, trench coat
Slow it down, switch the tempo
White wine, in slow
Curtains open, let the niggas watch us through the window
Lights out, candle lit
Im tryna see whats up right now
Got me open as a fuck right now
Probably why Im tryna fuck right now
Ill take that back, its the wrong impression
But I bet you 30 minutes leave a long impression
Hair pulled, with your back arched
I aint even gotta ask who this is
Foolishness, you heaven sent
And its evident how you do that shit
Got a compliment, yo confidence
Cause I love how you exude that shit
Already know you the illest alive
You dont even shine to prove that shit
Call it training day, I know wifey proud of me
Til I had a draining day, she suck the life right out of me
My turn, gon eat it
Turn over, but Im tryna keep it

Cant you see that Im gonna give you everything?
Everything that you need
What I really feel is
Sexual healing is what I am giving you
I know that Im a broke, girl wait
Switch positions, switch positions
I know that Im a broke, girl wait
Switch positions
Lets do it

Tonight lets get it lusty
I wanna touch you
And if it make you my girlfriend Im gonna cuff you
Maybe we can chill all day
Ride up on the beach and now I play
What you say?
(What you say?)
What you say? What you want?
What you need? Yea you know I like that fuck
Got that fire, anything I let you have
Just sex me

Full course meal, now the dinner gone
Closet full of clothes, still nothing but the skin is on
Dont matter if its your place or my place
But if mine, the patio got a fireplace
Trust me, you aint seen shit just yet
Not compared to how shit can get
Me on top of you dripping sweat
And that dont matter, you drippin wet
Your turn, on top
And you can crash here, just promise me you wont stop

Cant you see that Im gonna give you everything?
Everything that you need
What I really feel is
Sexual healing is what I am giving you
I know that Im a broke, girl wait
Switch positions, switch positions
I know that Im a broke, girl wait
Switch positions
Lets do it

Two rounds might lead to four
All the pain know how you feel low
We suckin on you, all while you bitin on that pillow
Same time next week but I asked her how she feel first
Said she wanted some days off, since she needed to heal first
She told me smack her ass like she was actin up
I told her put it down, but she backed it up
Our turn, one forever
Arrive separate but come together

Cant you see that Im gonna give you everything?
Everything that you need
What I really feel is
Sexual healing is what I am giving you
I know that Im a broke, girl wait
Switch positions, switch positions
I know that Im a broke, girl wait
Switch positions
Lets do it

Yea
You know?
I visualize
Every part of you
And I just
I cant help but to explore
Every part of you, yea
